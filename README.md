# Bodybuilding.com Store Index Page

Custom built landing page for the Store Index of Bodybuilding.com.
Can be viewed at https://www.bodybuilding.com/store

###Process
####Design
Page was designed and put together by UI/UX team at Bodybuilding.com.
Handed off through Invision App and Zeplin online collaboration tools.

###Coding
####Original
A page like this is fairly straightforward, with the only large complexity coming from the carousel and other interactions on the page. Originally the page used different carousel plugins to achieve the actions we wanted the carousel to perform.

The majority of the grids, and banners are positioned using Flexbox, and the page is designed to be fully responsive.

####Plugin Changes
A couple weeks after launching, I began to run into issues with the plugins being used in obscure use cases, very old browsers, and other hard to test areas. This led to my developing a custom plugin for the carousels, one that fit our exact specifications.
